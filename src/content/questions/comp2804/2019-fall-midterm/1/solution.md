1. Determine pombinations

   We choose 1 of the $f$ girls to be the president: $\binom{f}{1}=f$

   We choose 3 of the remaining $f-1$ girls and m guys to be vice presidents: $\binom{f-1+m}{3}$

2. Profit

   Thus, the total number of ways to choose the president and vice presidents is $f \cdot \binom{f-1+m}{3}$
