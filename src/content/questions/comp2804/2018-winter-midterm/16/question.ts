In the fall term of 2015, Nick took COMP 2804. Nick was always sitting in the back of the classroom
		and spent most of his time eating bananas. <br>
		
		Nick buys 25 bananas at Alexa's Banana Emporium (ABE) and 30 bananas at Shelly's Fruit Market (SFM).
		Nick chooses, uniformly at random, a 15-element subset of these bananas. Define the event
		<ul>
  <li> A = "the subset chosen by Nick contains exactly 7 bananas from ABE".</li>
		</ul>
		What is $\Pr(A)$?
