We flip a fair coin three times; these flips are independent of each other. These three coin flips
		give us a sequence of length three, where each symbol is $H$ or $T$. Define the events (recall that
		0 is even):
		<ul>
  <li> A = "the number of $H$ in the sequence is even",</li>
  <li> B = "the sequence contains at least two consecutive $H$'s".</li>
		</ul>
		Which of the following is true?
