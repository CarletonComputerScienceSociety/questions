When a couple has a child, this child is a boy with probability 1/2 and a girl with probability
		1/2, independent of the gender of previous children. A couple stops having children as soon as
		they have a child that has the same gender as their first child. Define the events
		<ul>
  <li> A = "the second child is a boy"</li>
		</ul>
		and
		<ul>
  <li> B = "the couple has at least three children and the third child is a boy".</li>
