The Carleton Computer Science Society (CCSS) is organizing their annual Saint Patrick's Day party.
		The CCSS has bought three types of drinks:
		<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
			<li>
				Porterhouse Brewing Co. Oyster Stout,
			</li>
			<li>
				Guinness Extra Stout,
			</li>
			<li>
				Magners Original Irish Cider.
			</li>
		</ul>
		There is an unlimited supply for each of these types. <br>
		There are 75 students at the party, and each of them gets one drink, which is chosen uniformly at random from these three types. <br>
		Let $A$ be the event
		<ul>
  <li> A = "exactly 50 students get Magners Original Irish Cider".</li>
		</ul>
		What is $\Pr(A)$?
