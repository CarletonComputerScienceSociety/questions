After having proctored the midterm, Alexa, Farah, May, and Shelly decide to go trick-or-treating.
		For any house that the ladies visit, if they do not receive candy, they throw rotten eggs at the
		house. <br>
		
		Let $m \geq 7$ and $n \geq 7$ be integers. There are $m$ houses whose owners hand out candy and
		there are $n$ houses whose owners do not hand out candy. <br>
		
		The ladies choose a uniformly random subset of 7 houses and visit these 7 houses. Define the event
		<ul>
  <li> A = "the ladies throw rotten eggs at exactly 2 of the 7 chosen houses".</li>
		</ul>
		What is $\Pr(A)$?
