You are given that:
		<ul style="margin: 0.5rem 0;">
			<li>
				The course COMP 9999 runs over a period of one year, starting on January 1 and ending on December
				31. There is one lecture every day; thus, the total number of lectures is 365.
			</li>
			<li>
				Dania and Nick take this course. Dania's birthday is on November 19. Nick's birthday is on December
				3.
			</li>
			<li>
				Professor G. Ruesome teaches the course. Professor Ruesome decides to have 20 quizzes during the
				year. For this, he chooses a uniformly random subset of 20 days; the quizzes will be on the 20
				chosen days. (It is possible that there is a quiz on January 1.)
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		Determine the conditional probability $\Pr(B|C)$, where $B$ and $C$ are the events
		<ul>
  <li> B = "there is a quiz on Nick's birthday",</li>
  <li> C = "there are exactly 5 quizzes in December".</li>
